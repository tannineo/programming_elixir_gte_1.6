## Value Types

### Integers

- decimal: `1234` or `1_000_0000`
- hexadecimal: `0xcafe`
- octal: `0o765`
- binary: `0b1010`

There is no fixed limit on the size of integers - their internal representation grows to fit their magnitude. (自动大数

### Floating-Point Numbers

```elixir
1.0
0.2456
0.314159e1
314159.0e-5
```

Floats are IEEE 754 double precision, giving them about 16 digits of accuracy and a maximum exponent of around 10^308.

### Atoms

The value of an atom is the name, for example:

```elixir
:fred
:is_binary?
:var@2
:<>
:===
:"func/3"
:"long john silver"
:эликсир
:mötley_crüe
:hey!
:原子
```

A leading colon (:) + an atom word or an Elixir operator

An atom word is a sequence of UTF-8 letters (including combining marks), digits, underscores, and at signs (@). It may end with an exclamation point `!` or a question mark `?` .

Two atoms with the same name will always compare as being equal, even if they were created by different applications on two computers separated by an ocean. (like strings?)

### Ranges

`start..end`, where start and end are integers

### Regular Expressions

The regular expressions can be written as `~r{regexp}` or `~r{regexp}opts`.

The delimiters can be replaced instead of `{}`, but `{}` is more common.

Elixir regular expression support is provided by PCRE (https://www.pcre.org/), which basically provides a Perl5-compatible syntax for patterns.

The `regexp` can be followed by more options as opts behind the delimiters.

|  opt  |                                                                                   meaning                                                                                    |
| :---: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|   f   |                                                 Force the pattern to start to match on the first line of a multiline string.                                                 |
|   i   |                                                                        Make matches case insensitive.                                                                        |
|   m   | If the string to be matched contains multiple lines, `^` and `$` match the start and end of these lines. `\A` and `\z` continue to match the beginning or end of the string. |
|   s   |                                                                  Allow `.` to match any newline characters.                                                                  |
|   U   |             Normally modifiers like `*` and `+` are greedy, matching as much as possible. The `U` modifier makes them ungreedy, matching as little as possible.              |
|   u   |                                                                 Enable unicode-specific patterns like `\p`.                                                                  |
|   x   |                                                  Enable extended mode-ignore whitespace and comments (`#` to end of line).                                                   |

```text
iex> Regex.run ~r{[aeiou]}, "caterpillar"
["a"]
iex> Regex.scan ~r{[aeiou]}, "caterpillar"
[["a"], ["e"], ["i"], ["a"]]
iex> Regex.split ~r{[aeiou]}, "caterpillar"
["c", "t", "rp", "ll", "r"]
iex> Regex.replace ~r{[aeiou]}, "caterpillar", "*"
"c*t*rp*ll*r"
```

## System Types

These types reflect resources in the underlying Erlang VM.


### PIDs and Ports

A PID is a reference to a local or remote process, and a port is a reference to a resource (typically external to the application) that you’ll be reading or writing.

`self` is the current process.

### References

Function `make_ref` creates a globally unique reference; no other reference will be equal to it.

TODO: Dive into references

```text
iex(3)> h make_ref

                                 def make_ref()

  @spec make_ref() :: reference()

Returns an almost unique reference.

The returned reference will re-occur after approximately 2^82 calls; therefore
it is unique enough for practical purposes.

Inlined by the compiler.

## Examples

    make_ref()
    #=> #Reference<0.0.0.135>
```

## Collection Types

### Tuples

A tuple is an ordered collection of values.

As with all Elixir data structures, once created a tuple cannot be modified.

Use tuples for pattern matching:

```text
iex> {status, count, action} = {:ok, 42, "next"}
{:ok, 42, "next"}
```

It's common for functions to return a tuple for multiple values:

```text
iex> {status, file} = File.open("mix.exs")
{:ok, #PID<0.39.0>}
iex> { :ok, file } = File.open("non-existent-file")
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:error, :enoent}
```

### Lists

Lists use recursive definition:

> A list may either be empty or consist of a head and a tail.
> The head contains a value and the tail is itself a list.

So it's a linked data structure, not like conventional arrays (tuples instead are the closest to arrays). Easy to traverse but hard to access randomly.

It is always cheap to get the head of a list and to extract the tail of a list.

Lists operations:

```text
iex> [1,2,3]++[4,5,6] # concatenation
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
iex> [1, 2, 3, 4] -- [2, 4] # difference
[1, 3]
iex> 1 in [1,2,3,4]
true
iex> "wombat" in [1, 2, 3, 4] # membership
false
```

Shortcut to write a list of k-v tuples:

```elixir
[ name: "Dave", city: "Dallas", likes: "Programming" ]
# is acutally...
[ {:name, "Dave"}, {:city, "Dallas"}, {:likes, "Programming"} ]
```

Elixir allows us to leave off the square brackets if a keyword list is the last argument in a function call. Thus,

```elixir
DB.save record, [ {:use_transaction, true}, {:logging, "HIGH"} ]
```

can be written more cleanly as

```elixir
DB.save record, use_transaction: true, logging: "HIGH"
```

We can also leave off the brackets if a keyword list appears as the last item in any context where a list of values is expected.

```text
iex> [1, fred: 1, dave: 2]
[1, {:fred, 1}, {:dave, 2}]
iex> {1, fred: 1, dave: 2}
{1, [fred: 1, dave: 2]}
```

### Maps

A map is a collection of key/value pairs.

```elixir
%{"AL" => "Alabama", "WI" => "Wisconsin"}

# with different types of keys/values
%{:two => 2, {1, 1, 1} => 3, "one" => "1"}

# atoms as keys
%{ red: 0xff0000, green: 0x00ff00, blue: 0x0000ff }
```

Maps allow only one entry for a particular key, whereas keyword lists allow the key to be repeated.

In general, use keyword lists for things such as command-line parameters and passing around options, and use maps when you want an associative array.

Use `[]` to access data in maps.

```text
iex> states = %{ "AL" => "Alabama", "WI" => "Wisconsin" }
%{"AL" => "Alabama", "WI" => "Wisconsin"}

iex> states["AL"]
"Alabama"

iex> states["TX"]
nil

iex> response_types = %{ { :error, :enoent } => :fatal,
...> { :error, :busy } => :retry }
%{{:error, :busy} => :retry, {:error, :enoent} => :fatal}

iex> response_types[{:error,:busy}]
:retry
```

```text
# use dot notation when the keys are atoms

iex> colors = %{ red: 0xff0000, green: 0x00ff00, blue: 0x0000ff }
%{blue: 255, green: 65280, red: 16711680}

iex> colors[:red]
16711680

iex> colors.green
65280

iex> colors.redd
** (KeyError) key :redd not found in: %{blue: 255, green: 65280, red: 16711680}. Did you mean one of:

      * :red
```

### Binaries

Elixir supports this with the binary data type. Binary literals are enclosed between `<<` and `>>`.

```text
iex(10)> bin = << 2, 3, 3>>
<<2, 3, 3>>

iex(11)> byte_size bin
3
```

Use modifiers to control the type and size of each field.

```text
iex(14)> bin = <<3 :: size(2), 5 :: size(4), 1 :: size(2)>>
<<213>>

iex(15)> :io.format("~-8.2b~n", :binary.bin_to_list(bin))
11010101
:ok

iex(16)> byte_size bin
1
```

Elixir uses them to represent UTF8 strings:

```text
iex(13)> bin = <<3 :: size(2), 5 :: size(4), 1 :: size(3), 2 :: size(7)>>
"Ԃ"
```

### Dates and Times

Elixir 1.3 added a calendar module and four new date- and time-related types.

The `Calendar` module represents the rules used to manipulate dates.

The only current implementation is `Calendar.ISO`, the ISO-8601 representation of the Gregorian calendar.

```text
iex(17)> d1 = Date.new(2020, 07, 01)
{:ok, ~D[2020-07-01]}

iex(18)> {:ok, d1} = Date.new(2020, 07, 01)
{:ok, ~D[2020-07-01]}

iex(19)> d2 = ~D[2020-07-01]
~D[2020-07-01]

iex(20)> d1 == d2
true

iex(21)> Date.day_of_week(d1)
3

iex(22)> Date.add(d1, 7)
~D[2020-07-08]

iex(23)> inspect d1, structs: false
"%{__struct__: Date, calendar: Calendar.ISO, day: 1, month: 7, year: 2020}"
```

A date range, "Aug. 1st" is included:

```text
iex(24)> d1 = ~D[2020-07-01]
~D[2020-07-01]

iex(25)> d2 = ~D[2020-08-01]
~D[2020-08-01]

iex(26)> date_range = Date.range(d1, d2)
#DateRange<~D[2020-07-01], ~D[2020-08-01]>

iex(27)> Enum.count(date_range)
32

iex(28)> ~D[2020-08-01] in date_range
true
```

The Time type contains an hour, a minute, a second, and fractions of a second.

The fraction is stored as a tuple containing microseconds and the number of significant digits.

```text
iex(1)> {:ok, t1} = Time.new(12, 34, 56)
{:ok, ~T[12:34:56]}

iex(2)> t2 = ~T[12:34:56.78]
~T[12:34:56.78]

iex(3)> t1 == t2
false

iex(4)> Time.add(t1, 3600)
~T[13:34:56.000000]

iex(5)> Time.add(t1, 3600, :millisecond)
~T[12:34:59.600000]
```

`NaiveDateTime` does not associate a time zone. The `~N[...]` sigil constructs `NaiveDateTime` structs.

```elixir
~N[2010-04-17 14:00:00]
```

## Names, Source Files, Conventions, Operators, and So On

### Variable Names

Elixir identifiers must start with a letter or underscore, optionally followed by letters, digits, and underscores.

Here letter means any UTF-8 letter character (optionally with a combining mark) and digit means a UTF-8 decimal-digit character.

Basically the ASCII chars we use in conventional languages work the same here.

Here are some examples of valid variables:

```elixir
name josé _age まつもと _42 адрес! 茶
```


And some examples of invalid variables:

```elixir
name• a±2 42
```

### Modules / Identifiers

Module, record, protocol, and behavior names start with an uppercase letter and are BumpyCase.

While all other identifiers start with a lowercase letter or an underscore, and by convention use underscores between words.

The underscore `_` means "redundant". If the first character is an underscore, Elixir doesn’t report a warning if the variable is unused in a pattern match or function parameter list.

### Intent Style

2-char intentation, space, not tabs.

### Comment

Line comment using `#`.

### Truth / Booleans

Atoms are aliased, so `true == :true`, `false == :false` are truthy.

`nil` is treated as false in Boolean contexts.

### Operators

#### Comparisons

```elixir

a === b # strict equality (so 1 === 1.0 is false)
a !== b # strict inequality (so 1 !== 1.0 is true)
a == b # value equality (so 1 == 1.0 is true)
a != b # value inequality (so 1 != 1.0 is false)

a > b # normal comparison
a >= b # :
a < b # :
a <= b # :
```

You can compare values of different types in Elixir, they follow the order like this:

> number < atom < reference < function < port < pid < tuple < map < list < binary

#### Boolean

and / or / not, these operators expect `true` or `false` as their first arg.

```elixir
a or b    # true if a is true; otherwise b
a and b   # false if a is false; otherwise b
not a     # false if a is true; true otherwise
```

Relaxed operators judging falsy and truthy:

```elixir
a || b   # a if a is truthy;o therwise b
a && b   # b if a is truthy; otherwise and
!a       # false if a is truthy; otherwise true
```

#### Arithmetic

`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `div`, `rem`

Integer division yields a floating-point result.

Use `div(a,b)` to get an integer.

`rem` is the remainder operator.
It is called as a function (`rem(11, 3)` => 2, `rem(-10, 3)` => -1).
It differs from normal modulo operations in that the result will have the same sign as the function’s first argument.

#### Join

```elixir
binary1 <> binary2 # concatenates two binaries (also strings)

list1 ++ list2     # concatenates two lists
list1 -- list2     # removes elements of list 2 from a copy of list 1
```

#### `in` operator

```elixir
a in enum   # tests if a is included in enum (for example,
            # a list, a range, or a map). For maps, a should
            # be a {key, value} tuple.
```

## Variable Scope

- Elixir is lexically scoped.
- The basic unit of scoping is the function body.
  - Variables defined in a function (including its parameters) are local to that function.
  - In addition, modules define a scope for local variables, but these are accessible only at the top level of that module, and not in functions defined in the module.

### Do-block Scope

Like in C, many languages use braces `{}` to define code block. In Elixir we use `do...end`

```elixir
line_no = 50
# ...
if (line_no == 50) do
  IO.puts "new-page\f"
  line_no = 0
end
IO.puts line_no
```

However, Elixir thinks this is a risky way to write code.

In particular, it’s easy to forget to initialize `line_no` outside the block, but to then rely on it having a value after the block.

### The `with` Expression

```elixir
content = "Now is the time"

lp = with {:ok, file}    = File.open("/etc/passwd"),
          content       = IO.read(file, :all),
          :ok           = File.close(file),
          [_, uid, gid] = Regex.run(~r/^lp:.*?:(\d+):(\d+)/m, content)
     do
          "Group: #{gid}, User: #{uid}"
     end

IO.puts lp
IO.puts content
```

Use `<-` in `with` block to get `nil` instead of raising an exception for pattern matching.

```elixir
[_, uid, gid] <- Regex.run(~r/^xxx:.*?:(\d+):(\d+)/, content)
```

Underneath the covers, with is treated by Elixir as if it were a call to a function or macro.

```elixir
mean = with count = Enum.count(values),
            sum = Enum.sum(values)
       do
            sum/count
       end

# or
mean = with(
         count = Enum.count(values),
         sum = Enum.sum(values)
       do
         sum/count
       end)

# or
mean = with count = Enum.count(values),
            sum = Enum.sum(values),
       do: sum/count
```
