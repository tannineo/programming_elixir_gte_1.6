# ch02 - Pattern Matching

## Assignment is not just assignment

unlearn assignment, `=` is more like assertion in maths.

'list assignment' is pattern matching, `=` is the match operator.

```elixir
a = [1,2,3] # OK
a = 4 # OK
4 = a # OK if right after `a = 4`
[a, b] = [1, 2, 3] # Oops
a = [[1, 2, 3]] # OK
[a] = [[1, 2, 3]] # OK
[[a]] = [[1, 2, 3]] # Oops
```

### Ignoring a Value with _ (Underscore)

```elixir
[1, _, _] = [1, 2, 3]
```

### Variables Bind Once (per Match)

```text
iex(3)> [a, b] = [1,2]
[1, 2]
iex(4)> [a, a] = [1, 1]
[1, 1]
iex(5)> [b, b] = [1, 2]
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [1, 2]
```

### Bind and Pin

`^` is the pin operator.

```text
iex(5)> a = 1
1
iex(6)> ^a = 1
1
iex(7)> ^a = 2
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 2
```
